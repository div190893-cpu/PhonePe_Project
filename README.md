# 📊 PhonePe Data Visualization & Insights Dashboard


Analyze and visualize PhonePe Pulse data to uncover trends in transactions, user engagement, and insurance metrics — empowering data-driven decisions in the digital payments ecosystem.

## 🧠 Project Overview

A complete data engineering and analytics project built using Python, MySQL, and Streamlit, inspired by real-world PhonePe transaction and insurance datasets.
This project visualizes transaction insights, device usage trends, and insurance coverage patterns across Indian states and districts through interactive dashboards and heatmaps.

### 📈 Transaction dynamics across states & districts

### 👥 User growth and engagement

### 💼 Insurance adoption & regional patterns

### 🗺️ Interactive geo-visualizations with maps and graphs
